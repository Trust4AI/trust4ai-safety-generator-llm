## Deployment

### Local deployment

To deploy the Safety Generator Component locally, please follow these steps carefully:

1. Prepare the necessary environment variables:
    1. Rename the `.env.local` file to `.env`.
    2. Depending on the model you want to use for generation, you will have to follow specific steps:
        1. For the use of **ChatGPT**, fill in the `.env` file the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key.

            ```.env
            PORT=8000
            GENERATOR_MODEL=ChatGPT
            OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
            NODE_ENV=local
            ```
        2. For the use of **GEMMA**, fill in the `.env` file the `GENERATOR_MODEL` environment variable with `gemma` value. In case you want to use a deployed GEMMA instance, add the `GEMMA_HOST` environment variable with the host of the GEMMA instance, otherwise, leave it empty.

            ```.env
            PORT=8000
            GENERATOR_MODEL=gemma
            GEMMA_HOST=<GEMMA_HOST>
            OPENAI_API_KEY=
            NODE_ENV=local
            ```

2. (If applicable) To use **GEMMA** as local generator model, you need to execute the following Docker Compose instruction to deploy a instance:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up gemma -d
    ```

3. Install the component dependencies:
    1. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system (version 16.x or newer is recommended). You can check your Node.js version by running `node -v` in your terminal.
    2. Navigate to the `src` directory and install the required dependencies:

        ```bash
        cd src
        npm install
        ```

4. Compile the source code and start the server:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm start
    ```

5. To verify that the Safety Generator Component is running, you can check the status of the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metamorphic-tests/check" -H  "accept: application/json"
    ```

6. Finally, you can access the API documentation by visiting the following URL in your web browser:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metamorphic-tests/docs
    ```

### Docker deployment

To deploy the Safety Generator Component using Docker, please follow these steps carefully:

1. Prepare the necessary environment variables:
    1. Rename the `.env.docker` file to `.env`.
    2. Depending on the model you want to use for generation, you will have to follow specific steps:
        1. For the use of **ChatGPT**, fill in the `.env` file the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable with your OpenAI API key.

            ```.env
            PORT=8000
            GENERATOR_MODEL=ChatGPT
            OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>
            NODE_ENV=docker
            ```
        2. For the use of **GEMMA**, fill in the `.env` file the `GENERATOR_MODEL` environment variable with `gemma` value. In case you want to use a deployed GEMMA instance, fill in the `.env` file the `GEMMA_HOST` environment variable with the host of the GEMMA instance, otherwise, leave it empty.

            ```.env
            PORT=8000
            GENERATOR_MODEL=gemma
            GEMMA_HOST=<GEMMA_HOST>
            OPENAI_API_KEY=
            NODE_ENV=docker
            ```

2. Depending on the model you want to use for generation, the command to execute to launch the component may vary.

    1. If you want to use **GEMMA** as local generator model, you need to execute the following Docker Compose instruction:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up server gemma -d
    ```

    2. Otherwise, if you want to use **ChatGPT** as generator model, you need to execute the following Docker Compose instruction:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up server -d
    ```

3. To verify that the Safety Generator Component is running, you can check the status of the server by running the following command:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metamorphic-tests/check" -H  "accept: application/json"
    ```

4. Finally, you can access the API documentation by visiting the following URL in your web browser:

    ```
    http://localhost:8000/api/v1/metamorphic-tests/docs
    ```
